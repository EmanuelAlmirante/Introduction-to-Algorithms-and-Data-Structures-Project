## Objetives

This repository will have the project I did for the course of IADS in college. The project is a simple one, but that contains the most fundamental concepts of the programming language C.

Over time, I will try to improve the code the best I can. Any help or recommendation is welcome, so feel free to change the code. 

## Part 1

Note: the abbreviations of the countries derived from their names in portuguese.

There are 17 countries in the Eurozone (EZ): Germany (ALE), Austria (AUT), Belgium (BEL), Cyprus (CHI), Slovakia (ESL), Slovenia (ELO), Spain (ESP), Estonia (EST), Finland (FIN), France (FRA), Greece (GRE), Netherlands (HOL), Ireland (IRL), Italy (ITA), Luxembourg (LUX), Malta (MAL), Portugal (POR).

At any given time, the countries can suffer an economic intervention or to default. The risk of suffering an intervention and to default are related with the country's debt and it's GDP. In this context we assume that when the debt of country **X** is greater than a **Pi** percentage of it's GDP, the country is in risk of suffering an intervention. The same way, when the debt of country **Y** is greater than a **Pd** of it's GDP, then the country is in risk of defaulting. **Pd** is always greater than **Pi**.
